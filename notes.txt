Thinking about
    action outlier punishment
        If you are an extreme outlier in your action, it is considerred inaccurate
        min of 10 reviews
        choosen action is choosen in less than 10 percent of reviews
    favicon for each site?
    none for offence?
    new offences
        racist/sexist
        user underage
        dox
        impersonating a mod
        get

confidence logic
    post submitted by users
    defaults to none offence
    first review gives confidence of 1 with those settings
    if 1 confidence, next review will overwrite
    if review is same as current config confidence goes up
    penalty/rewards when confidence is 3 or higher
