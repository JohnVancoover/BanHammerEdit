I don''t want any of my cum to get inside her leg joints, and I cum buckets when I do it with her, so I have to be extra careful (sometimes my cum literally shoots out the sides like in my hentai animes; and since the onahole creates its own suction, you can hear an audible spurt when it bursts out the side; shit turns me on so much). I clean the doll parts with a paper towel and some alcohol. Fully rinsing doll parts create risk for mold since it''s virtually impossible to dry the insides of the legs hence I avoid getting my cum or the lube to overflow in there.\nJust keep her canal aimed upwards as you disassemble her legs.\n\nIn conclusion there''s a bit of a learning curve to making love with your doll, but as fellow dollfags, it''s worth it given how much we love them. The invention of dollhos is god''s work.\n\nON THE OTHER HAND there are 65cm china dolls (WM dolls/Sanhui/etc.) that you can just replace the stock [hideous] heads with volks DD heads (don''t know what kind of modifications needed though). You get a full skeleton (albeit wired) and full TPE body, so way more freedom and durability (you can be rougher, easier to pose for different positions, and you can cum on their bodies), though it''s $550 and durability of wire skeleton is questionable. Also since it''s 5cm taller it does look a bit bigger compared to a DD body. Clothes still fit though.\n\nAlso a lot of jp also use other onaholes; they just surgically mod them to work like dollhos (cut hole underneath canal for leg axle, spine mod to hold arm axles, cut out breasts of torso to accommodate the entire onahole).\n\nGo to xham for vids (tenanmon has the most OHD videos) or the SOF bukkake board dot net ("bukkake" spelled in hiragana + 板); they have a dollho board.

There is *no* weight support for this, only the joint silicone of the onahole on the bottom/the perineum. As a result, unless you''re supporting her legs too and making sure they''re matching the rhythm of your dick, this will stretch that perineum thin (because you''re thrusting upwards her and her legs will get left behind), and eventually it will get thin and brittle (I fixed mines with silicone glue though). Whether you''re standing fucking her, missionary on the bed, or doggy, the legs always have a tendency of being left behind and stretching that perineum part.\nSo, left unmodified, you''ll basically have to cradle her as you fuck her. Which is not too bad, but the increased wear and tear is exponentially higher.\nNow I say "unmodified" because there is this thing called a "spine mod" that we dollho fags do. You can search for dollfielover on xham on how to do it, but basically all you have to do is take solid copper wiring (I use 14 gauge), stab through from the bottom leg area (being careful not to stab the canal), to the top, and coiling the tops and bottoms for the arm and leg axle tubes to go through. This creates a spine that not only stops the hanging leg problem, but the droopiness of the entire torso. It''s a must in my opinion. Just a bit nerve wracking not to stab the canal. It''ll enable you to be much more rougher with her, and do stuff like standing or kneeling doggy style with ease. No more saggy torso or legs.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2, '2017-02-21 04:10:08', '2017-02-12 05:09:33'),
